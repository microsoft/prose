# Microsoft Program Synthesis using Examples SDK

The Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE) SDK includes a set of technologies for the automatic generation of programs
from input-output examples. This repo includes samples, release notes, and some other miscellaneous projects related to
the Microsoft PROSE SDK.

The samples are split into two categories:

- Samples for using existing PROSE DSL APIs to accomplish tasks in
  [api-samples/api-samples.sln](api-samples/api-samples.sln). 
- Samples for creating program synthesis solutions using the PROSE SDK by authoring a DSL in the
  [dsl-samples](dsl-samples) directory:
  - [DSL authoring tutorial](dsl-samples/tutorial)
  - [ProseSample](dsl-samples/ProseSample/ProseSample.sln)
  - [DSL for merge conflict resolution](dsl-samples/MergeConflictsResolution/MergeConflictsResolution.sln)

You can find guides for some of these sample projects and other information about the PROSE project here:
