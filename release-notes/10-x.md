# Release Notes for PROSE SDK versions 10.x

- **We no longer support .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.6.**

## [Release 10.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.3.0) - 2024-10-28
- Nearly all SDK projects now target only nestandard2.0 (but this should not change which kinds of projects can consume them since netstandard2.0 is consumable by net462 and newer as well as essentially all .net core versions).

- Extraction.Text.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Transformation.Tree.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Matching.Text
  - Add `ForbidJustAnyPattern` constraint which ensures no disjunct matching "[Any]+" (the pattern matching every string) will be learned. This may result in failing to cover all of the inputs.
  - Added `MayNotBeRestrictedCharClasses` and `MayNotBeUnrestrictedCharClasses` constraints to give more control over which tokens are used.

## [Release 10.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.2.0) - 2024-09-24

## [Release 10.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.1.0) - 2024-08-27
- Conditional.Formatting
  - Added column data type (text, numeric, dates) logging to package telemetry.
  - Improved gradient learner to suggest more ColorScale operations.

## [Release 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.0.0) - 2024-07-23
- ConditionalFormatting
  - Added new templates for data divided by month names for better localization for nominative and locative case.
  - Made target column index nullable. When not specified, it will infer the target column on its own.
  - (Suggestions) Changed date descriptions to `GenetiveMonthNames` instead of `MonthNames`.

- Matching.Text
  - Add `MergeSimilarClusters` constraint that attempts to make output less noisy by combining similar looking patterns.
  - Added `UnicodeTokens` parallel to `DefaultTokens` with variants of some of the default tokens using Unicode character classes instead of covering just ASCII.
