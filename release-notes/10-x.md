# Release Notes for PROSE SDK versions 10.x

- **We no longer support .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.6.**

## [Release 10.13.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.13.0) - 2025-07-02
- Extraction.Web
  - Removed dependency on System.Text.Encoding.CodePages in E.Web
  - Added option AllColumnCellsMustHaveMinimalText that, if set to false, enables EWeb to learn more tables. The default value, true, preserves the old EWeb behavior.
  - Upgraded AngleSharp version to 1.3.0 from 0.9.x.

- PandasToPyspark
  - Fixed bug in calculation of the parameter MaxResponseToken in LLM call

## [Release 10.12.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.12.1) - 2025-06-03
- Transformation.Formula
  - Support for learning loop programs using recursion and translating to Excel.

- Copilot.FabricPipeline: Added metadata to AppActionResult

## [Release 10.11.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.11.0) - 2025-05-02
- SDK
  - Tactics, both those marked with `[Tactic]`/`[DefaultTactic]` attributes and implementations of
    `ITactic.LearnAlternative` now take the `LearningTask` as the second argument, so it can be used in the tactic
    computation.
  - Added `[RegroupCalculator(ruleName)]` to `Feature`s which can be used to adjust ranking behavior for non-monotonic
    ranking features. It is put on a method with a return type of `IEnumerable<ProgramSet>` or
    `Optional<IEnumerable<ProgramSet>>` which takes a `JoinProgramSet` and `FeatureCalculationContext`. The return value
    can be `default` to revert to the default behavior or a collection of `ProgramSet`s that together represent the same
    programs as the input `JoinProgramSet`, but each will be ranked separately to ensure that at least one program from
    each of those `ProgramSet`s will be considered when ranking the overall `JoinProgramSet`.
  - Breaking change: `IFeature` has a new method `Optional<IEnumerable<ProgramSet>> RegroupProgramSet(JoinProgramSet
    set, FeatureCalculationContext fcc)`. The semantics are the same as described above except that the version on
    `IFeature` gets the `JoinProgramSet` for every rule. `Feature` uses it to delegate to those `[RegroupCalculator]`s
    based on the rule of the `JoinProgramSet`. If implementing `IFeature` directly instead of extending `Feature`, you
    can add an implementation returning `default` to get the current behavior.

- Paste.Table
  - Added more logging

## [Release 10.10.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.10.0) - 2025-04-03
- Transformation.Formula
  - Added support for learning Excel's DATEDIF()/DAYS() functions.
  - Added support to learn programs that reference the current datetime. Set `LearnOptions.Now` to the current datetime
    to enable this feature. The learned PROSE program will always reference the datetime used when learning, but
    translated programs will use the appropriate functions to get the current datetime.

- dslc
  - `.grammar` files can optionally specify "@option SoftRecursionLimit;" after the "language" line to make "@recurse"
    annotations soft. This makes them not cause a performance hit, but programs may be learned that exceed the limits as
    while learning will not exceed the limit, it may load a cached intermediate result from a different learning branch
    that does exceed the limit.

## [Release 10.9.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.9.0) - 2025-03-12
- Transformation.Formula
  - `Time` can be used as an output type for programs and examples. Note that `Time` is a type defined by
    Transformation.Formula which is similar but not identical to the `TimeOnly` type added in .NET 6, which it cannot
    use due to supporting older .NET versions.

## [Release 10.8.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.8.0) - 2025-03-06
- Extraction.Json
  - Added `ColumnsLimit` constraint to avoid problems with learning undesired huge programs. Defaults to 1000.

- Nuget packages now include binaries for .net 4.6.2 and .net 8.0 in addition to netstandard 2.0 (which was the only
  - version included previously).

- Added `Constraint.ConflictBuckets` property which, if non-`null`, `Constraints.ConflictsWith()` will only be called
  for Constraints whose `ConflictBuckets` have a non-empty intersection.

- Extraction.Text
  - Added `StringIndexingModeConstraint` to control how Unicode is treated. Note that this is also used for the
    translation, so it must be set to `Rune` for Python translation to work properly on all inputs.

## [Release 10.7.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.7.0) - 2025-02-19

## [Release 10.6.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.6.5) - 2025-02-07
- Extraction.Web
  - Fixed bug in CSS class name escaping that threw an exception on class names starting with a digit.

- Extraction.Text
  - Added TranslationTargetConstraint so when learning programs to be translated to PowerQuery M, regular expressions
    will not be used.

- Split.Text
  - Added StringIndexingModeConstraint to specify if indexes for fixed-width splits should be in terms of UTF-16 code
    points ("Char"), Unicode characters ("Rune"), or text elements.
  - Added a new constraint called "DisjointColumnsConstraint" that allows users to ask for only those splits that
    generate non-overlapping columns.

- Read.FlatFile
  - Added constraint to require split-based learned tables to have disjoint columns.
  - Added option to read files using Split.Text.

- Transformation.Formula
  - Added a With method to PySparkTranslationConstraint to enable setting it.
  - Updated generated regular expressions to ensure they run compatibly on PCRE2.

## [Release 10.4.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.4.1) - 2024-11-28
*10.4.0 is superseded by 10.4.1.*

## [Release 10.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.3.0) - 2024-10-28
- Nearly all SDK projects now target only nestandard2.0 (but this should not change which kinds of projects can consume
  them since netstandard2.0 is consumable by net462 and newer as well as essentially all .net core versions).

- Extraction.Text.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Transformation.Tree.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Matching.Text
  - Add `ForbidJustAnyPattern` constraint which ensures no disjunct matching "[Any]+" (the pattern matching every
    string) will be learned. This may result in failing to cover all of the inputs. 
  - Added `MayNotBeRestrictedCharClasses` and `MayNotBeUnrestrictedCharClasses` constraints to give more control over
    which tokens are used. 

## [Release 10.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.2.0) - 2024-09-24

## [Release 10.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.1.0) - 2024-08-27
- Conditional.Formatting
  - Added column data type (text, numeric, dates) logging to package telemetry.
  - Improved gradient learner to suggest more ColorScale operations.

## [Release 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.0.0) - 2024-07-23
- ConditionalFormatting
  - Added new templates for data divided by month names for better localization for nominative and locative case.
  - Made target column index nullable. When not specified, it will infer the target column on its own.
  - (Suggestions) Changed date descriptions to `GenetiveMonthNames` instead of `MonthNames`.

- Matching.Text
  - Add `MergeSimilarClusters` constraint that attempts to make output less noisy by combining similar looking patterns.
  - Added `UnicodeTokens` parallel to `DefaultTokens` with variants of some of the default tokens using Unicode
    character classes instead of covering just ASCII.
