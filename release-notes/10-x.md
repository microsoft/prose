# Release Notes for PROSE SDK versions 10.x

- **We no longer support .NET 4.5 and .NET 4.6.**

## [Release 10.8.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.8.0) - 2025-03-06
- Extraction.Json
  - Added `ColumnsLimit` constraint to avoid problems with learning undesired huge programs. Defaults to 1000.

- Nuget packages now include binaries for .net 4.6.2 and .net 8.0 in addition to netstandard 2.0 (which was the only
  - version included previously).

- Added `Constraint.ConflictBuckets` property which, if non-`null`, `Constraints.ConflictsWith()` will only be called for Constraints whose `ConflictBuckets` have a non-empty intersection.

- Extraction.Text
  - Added `StringIndexingModeConstraint` to control how Unicode is treated. Note that this is also used for the translation, so it must be set to `Rune` for Python translation to work properly on all inputs.

## [Release 10.7.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.7.0) - 2025-02-19

## [Release 10.6.5](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.6.5) - 2025-02-07
- Extraction.Web
  - Fixed bug in CSS class name escaping that threw an exception on class names starting with a digit.

- Extraction.Text
  - Added TranslationTargetConstraint so when learning programs to be translated to PowerQuery M, regular expressions
    will not be used.

- Split.Text
  - Added StringIndexingModeConstraint to specify if indexes for fixed-width splits should be in terms of UTF-16 code
    points ("Char"), Unicode characters ("Rune"), or text elements.
  - Added a new constraint called "DisjointColumnsConstraint" that allows users to ask for only those splits that
    generate non-overlapping columns.

- Read.FlatFile
  - Added constraint to require split-based learned tables to have disjoint columns.
  - Added option to read files using Split.Text.

- Transformation.Formula
  - Added a With method to PySparkTranslationConstraint to enable setting it.
  - Updated generated regular expressions to ensure they run compatibly on PCRE2.

## [Release 10.4.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.4.1) - 2024-11-28
*10.4.0 is superseded by 10.4.1.*

## [Release 10.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.3.0) - 2024-10-28
- Nearly all SDK projects now target only nestandard2.0 (but this should not change which kinds of projects can consume
  them since netstandard2.0 is consumable by net462 and newer as well as essentially all .net core versions).

- Extraction.Text.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Transformation.Tree.Deprecated - REMOVED

- Matching.Text
  - Add `ForbidJustAnyPattern` constraint which ensures no disjunct matching "[Any]+" (the pattern matching every
    string) will be learned. This may result in failing to cover all of the inputs. 
  - Added `MayNotBeRestrictedCharClasses` and `MayNotBeUnrestrictedCharClasses` constraints to give more control over
    which tokens are used. 

## [Release 10.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.2.0) - 2024-09-24

## [Release 10.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.1.0) - 2024-08-27
- Conditional.Formatting
  - Added column data type (text, numeric, dates) logging to package telemetry.
  - Improved gradient learner to suggest more ColorScale operations.

## [Release 10.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/10.0.0) - 2024-07-23
- ConditionalFormatting
  - Added new templates for data divided by month names for better localization for nominative and locative case.
  - Made target column index nullable. When not specified, it will infer the target column on its own.
  - (Suggestions) Changed date descriptions to `GenetiveMonthNames` instead of `MonthNames`.

- Matching.Text
  - Add `MergeSimilarClusters` constraint that attempts to make output less noisy by combining similar looking patterns.
  - Added `UnicodeTokens` parallel to `DefaultTokens` with variants of some of the default tokens using Unicode
    character classes instead of covering just ASCII.
